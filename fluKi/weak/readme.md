Practical Training #1 on `weak perturbations`
============================================

In this first numerical experiment we consider the propagation of a small perturbation in a compressible fluid (fluid approach) and in a collisionless plasma (kinetic approach).
The perturbation is initiated by a thin slab of fluid slowly moving with respect to the surrounding resting fluid.
The slab is translationally invariant in the `y` direction and moving in the `x` direction.
The perturbation is "small" as the initial velocity of the slab is small with respect to the sound speed.

This directory contains 4 python scripts called `wp1.py`, `wp2.py`, `wp3.py`, `wp4.py`, all set with a ion temperature `Ti = 0.125`, and an electron temperature equal `Te = 0.025`, `Te = 0.125`, `Te = 25` and `Te = 1.25`, respectively.
