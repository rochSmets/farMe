Fluid and kinetic description of a plasma
=========================================

This repository contains the pyhton scripts to run the [PHARE](https://github.com/PHAREHUB/PHARE) code in dedicated case studies and associated jupyter notebooks to work on the data.
This training is proposed by the _Doctoral School_ `Astronomie et Astrophysique d'Ile de France`.
The training does not require any previous knowledge in the ﬁeld of plasma physics or numerical computation.
Notions and tools necessary to run and analyze the simulations, mainly through images, plots and movies, will be introduced gradually.
The proposed questions are merely meant to guide reflection.
Feel free to run your own simulations if you ﬁnd the proposed ones excessively boring.
